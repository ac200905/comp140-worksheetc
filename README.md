## Game Proposal

I would like to create a 2D top down game in which the player controls a WW2 mortar and has to hit targets on a battlefield.

### Core Mechanics
* Player controls a mortar with a fixed position at the bottom of the screen.
* 180 degree rotation movement to aim the mortar in the x-axis.
* Different elevations on the mortar to change the firing distance.
* Destroy targets on the battlefield in a time limit.


## Controller Proposal

I would like to create two physical cranks that could control the rotation of the mortar and the elevation of the mortar to adjust distance to fire.
I would like to make a small rough replica of a mortar that would physically move as the targeting reticle on-screen is moved with the cranks.
I thought that placing a ball in the tube with a sensor at the bottom could simulate the firing mechanism.


## Research
I got the idea for the crank mechanism from a couple of alt controllers, the Tank Controller that was created by a former student, in which a crank was rotated to change the rotation of the turret on a tank, and the Safe game in which a valve is rotated to open a safe. I will have two crank systems to change the targeting position of the mortar.
Chicken Jump is an endless jumper for 1 to 8 players in which you need to avoid cars and trucks. It can be played at home on a keyboard, but is much more fun with physical pads on which the players have to jump. This game gave me the idea to possibly use a pressure sensor to control the firing mechanism.
