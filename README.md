## Game Proposal

I would like to create a 2D top down 'Space Invaders' style game in which the player controls a trebuchet and has to hit units on a battlefield as well as possibly the city gates of an enemy stronghold.

### Core Mechanics
* Player controls a trebuchet with a fixed position at the bottom of the screen.
* 180 degree rotation movement to aim the trebuchet.
* Several set distances that the trebuchet is calibrated for.
* Destroy the enemy army before it reaches you.
* Once the defending army reaches the player the game is over.

### Stretch Goals
* Destroy City Gates and watchtowers for extra points.
* A friendly army to encourage more precise aiming to limit friendly fire.

## Controller Proposal

I would like to create a physical crank that could control the rotation of the trebuchet and thus be used to aim.
The distance the projectile would travel would be based on how much weight was in a counterweight. 
I thought this could be simulated by placing various weights in a container with a pressure sensor or electronic scales.
The more weight is added to the counterweight, the further the projectile will fly.
A lever with a simple on/off connection could be used to fire the trebuchet.

## Research
I got the idea for the crank mechanism from a couple of alt controllers, the Tank Controller that was created by a former student, in which a crank was rotated to change the rotation of the turret on a tank, and the Safe game in which a valve is rotated to open a safe. My crank system will be different in that it will be a horizontal crank.
Chicken Jump is an endless jumper for 1 to 8 players in which you need to avoid cars and trucks. It can be played at home on a keyboard, but is much more fun with physical pads on which the players have to jump. This game gave me the idea to use pressure sensors to control how far the projectile is thrown.
